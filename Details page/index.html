    <p class="description">While hosting a party in the town of Del Mar, legendary hero and outlaw Puss in Boots accidentally awakens a sleeping giant. He subdues the creature but is crushed by a bell. Waking up in a hospital, Puss is informed by the town doctor that he has lost eight of his nine lives. The doctor suggests to Puss that he should retire, but he refuses. That night in a bar, Puss meets a black-hooded wolf, who disarms and wounds him in a swordfight. Traumatized, Puss flees to the house of cat lady Mama Luna, burying his clothes in her yard. Later, Puss meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat, whom he calls Perrito. Goldilocks and her Three Bears Crime Family soon arrive at Luna's home, looking to hire Puss to help them steal a map bearing the Wishing Star's location. However, they fail to recognize him, and leave after finding his "grave". Puss decides to use the Star to restore his lost lives.
